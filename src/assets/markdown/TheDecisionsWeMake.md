# Is Thought the Enemy of Action?

## The allure of immediate action

I often recall a quote I cherish, prominently displayed on my website, by the Roman poet Horace: "Don't think, just do." It resonates with me because, when faced with even the simplest tasks, like tidying up, overthinking can lead me down a path of procrastination.

While it is true that in the moment, making the choice to not act, whether that inaction is due to the initial thought, 'Should I do this?', or some other reason, can feel like a relief, it often leads to a sense of regret later on.

## The internal struggle

The question "Do I get up and clean this up?" ignites a mini-battle within oneself. The mind begins to determine reasons why it's okay to not act. "I'm tired," "I've had a busy day" or "I'll do it later" are common justifications.

In my experience though, when these jsutifications have prevailed, I've often found myself feeling worse later on. The mess I've left behind becomes a source of stress, and I'm left wondering why I didn't just take care of it when I had the chance. Often the next thought involves some form of "It would have only taken ...". What "..." is worth the stress and regret?

## Self-deception and the common thread

The justifications I weave may seem reasonable, but ultimately boil down to one truth: I simply don't want to do it. Sometimes, I have even had a consistent battle with myself, where I'll think "I should do this" and then immediately follow it up with "I don't want to do this." It's a strange internal struggle, but I don't think it is one I experience alone.

Often, this internal struggle is a result of the mind's desire to avoid discomfort. It's easier to not act, to not take on the discomfort of the task at hand. But, as I've found, the discomfort of the task is often less than the discomfort of the regret that follows inaction.

I believe regret often adds a little bit of weight to the mind, and over time the cumulation of these regrets, and any additional weight, can lead to a sense of being overwhelmed. It's a cycle that can be difficult to break, and one that I am hoping these blogs can help me continue to break, and help some others in the process.

## What can I do?

I think the first step is to recognize the cycle. I've found that, by acknowledging the cycle, we can begin to break it. We can also look into the reasons why we don't want to act. Is it truly because we're tired?

As you ponder what your reasons might be, consider the techniques below:

| Technique | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Pomodoro Technique | This popular method involves working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks in between. It can help individuals maintain concentration and avoid feeling overwhelmed by large tasks. |
| The Eisenhower Matrix | This framework categorizes tasks based on urgency and importance, helping individuals prioritize effectively and avoid getting bogged down in unimportant tasks. |
| The "Just Start" Method | Sometimes, the hardest part is simply beginning. Encourage readers to adopt the "just start" mentality, taking even a small step towards their goal to gain momentum and overcome the initial hurdle. |
| Reward System | Implement a reward system for completing tasks, providing positive reinforcement and motivation to continue taking action. |
| Eliminate Distractions | Identify and minimize distractions, such as turning off notifications or silencing phones, to create a focused work environment. |

## Shared experience

If it is true that I'm not alone in this, please reach out. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. I'm always open to learning from others, and I believe that sharing our experiences can help us all grow.

## The Decisions We Make

At the end of everything, I think the most important things, are those decisions we make. I know that I have definitely made the wrong decisions at times and I hope to continue to learn from them. I think a simple decision I can make though, in most cases, is the final one: to act or not act. My action is to wish that you, the reader, will have a great day and make only the decisions that will benefit you most, even if it might mean a little discomfort in the short term.
