# Developer Personal Notes

Here you can write your personal development notes. This is a good place to write down your thoughts, ideas, and plans. Feel free to use this however you like. It will not be added to Git.

Note: This file might be named `_Personal.md`. Ensure that your **Personal Notes** are not included in this template file.

Consider: Remaking DevBook as a separate package using `Project Manager`.
