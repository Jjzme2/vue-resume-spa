(function(){var e={2540:function(e){e.exports='<h1 id="is-thought-the-enemy-of-action">Is Thought the Enemy of Action?</h1>\n<h2 id="the-allure-of-immediate-action">The allure of immediate action</h2>\n<p>I often recall a quote I cherish, prominently displayed on my website, by the Roman poet Horace: &quot;Don&#39;t think, just do.&quot; It resonates with me because, when faced with even the simplest tasks, like tidying up, overthinking can lead me down a path of procrastination.</p>\n<p>While it is true that in the moment, making the choice to not act, whether that inaction is due to the initial thought, &#39;Should I do this?&#39;, or some other reason, can feel like a relief, it often leads to a sense of regret later on.</p>\n<h2 id="the-internal-struggle">The internal struggle</h2>\n<p>The question &quot;Do I get up and clean this up?&quot; ignites a mini-battle within oneself. The mind begins to determine reasons why it&#39;s okay to not act. &quot;I&#39;m tired,&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve had a busy day&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll do it later&quot; are common justifications.</p>\n<p>In my experience though, when these jsutifications have prevailed, I&#39;ve often found myself feeling worse later on. The mess I&#39;ve left behind becomes a source of stress, and I&#39;m left wondering why I didn&#39;t just take care of it when I had the chance. Often the next thought involves some form of &quot;It would have only taken ...&quot;. What &quot;...&quot; is worth the stress and regret?</p>\n<h2 id="self-deception-and-the-common-thread">Self-deception and the common thread</h2>\n<p>The justifications I weave may seem reasonable, but ultimately boil down to one truth: I simply don&#39;t want to do it. Sometimes, I have even had a consistent battle with myself, where I&#39;ll think &quot;I should do this&quot; and then immediately follow it up with &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot; It&#39;s a strange internal struggle, but I don&#39;t think it is one I experience alone.</p>\n<p>Often, this internal struggle is a result of the mind&#39;s desire to avoid discomfort. It&#39;s easier to not act, to not take on the discomfort of the task at hand. But, as I&#39;ve found, the discomfort of the task is often less than the discomfort of the regret that follows inaction.</p>\n<p>I believe regret often adds a little bit of weight to the mind, and over time the cumulation of these regrets, and any additional weight, can lead to a sense of being overwhelmed. It&#39;s a cycle that can be difficult to break, and one that I am hoping these blogs can help me continue to break, and help some others in the process.</p>\n<h2 id="what-can-i-do">What can I do?</h2>\n<p>I think the first step is to recognize the cycle. I&#39;ve found that, by acknowledging the cycle, we can begin to break it. We can also look into the reasons why we don&#39;t want to act. Is it truly because we&#39;re tired?</p>\n<p>As you ponder what your reasons might be, consider the techniques below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Technique</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>The Pomodoro Technique</td>\n<td>This popular method involves working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks in between. It can help individuals maintain concentration and avoid feeling overwhelmed by large tasks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Eisenhower Matrix</td>\n<td>This framework categorizes tasks based on urgency and importance, helping individuals prioritize effectively and avoid getting bogged down in unimportant tasks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The &quot;Just Start&quot; Method</td>\n<td>Sometimes, the hardest part is simply beginning. Encourage readers to adopt the &quot;just start&quot; mentality, taking even a small step towards their goal to gain momentum and overcome the initial hurdle.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reward System</td>\n<td>Implement a reward system for completing tasks, providing positive reinforcement and motivation to continue taking action.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eliminate Distractions</td>\n<td>Identify and minimize distractions, such as turning off notifications or silencing phones, to create a focused work environment.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id="shared-experience">Shared experience</h2>\n<p>If it is true that I&#39;m not alone in this, please reach out. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences. I&#39;m always open to learning from others, and I believe that sharing our experiences can help us all grow.</p>\n<h1 id="the-decisions-we-make">The Decisions We Make</h1>\n<p>At the end of everything, I think the most important things, are those decisions we make. I know that I have definitely made the wrong decisions at times and I hope to continue to learn from them. I think a simple decision I can make though, in most cases, is the final one: to act or not act. My action is to wish that you, the reader, will have a great day and make only the decisions that will benefit you most, even if it might mean a little discomfort in the short term.</p>\n'},3884:function(e){e.exports='<h1 id="the-importance-of-soc">The importance of SOC</h1>\n<h2 id="what-is-soc">What is SOC?</h2>\n<p>SOC stands for <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>.

This is because it allows for the separation of concerns, which makes it easier to understand and maintain the code.</p>\n<p>As you dive deeper into coding, you will find many examples of how things can be separated into different concerns. A really popular example is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This is a pattern that separates the concerns of the application into three different sections: the model, the view, and the controller.</p>\n'},5960:function(e){e.exports='<h1 id="what-is-a-static-website">What is a static website?</h1>\n<h2 id="benefits-of-static-websites">Benefits of static websites</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Speed</td>\n<td>Static websites are faster than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database to load the content.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>Static websites are more secure than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t have a database to hack.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td>Static websites are cheaper to host than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scalability</td>\n<td>Static websites are more scalable than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database to handle the load.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simplicity</td>\n<td>Static websites are easier to build and maintain than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id="who-could-this-be-for">Who could this be for?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Small businesses</strong>: If you&#39;re a small business owner, you can use a static website to promote your products and services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bloggers</strong>: If you&#39;re a blogger, you can use a static website to publish your content.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Developers</strong>: If you&#39;re a developer, you can use a static website to showcase your portfolio.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Non-profits</strong>: If you&#39;re a non-profit organization, you can use a static website to raise awareness for your cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Freelancers</strong>: If you&#39;re a freelancer, you can use a static website to promote your services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Students</strong>: If you&#39;re a student, you can use a static website to showcase your projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n'},1920:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var n=o(7764),a=o(4108);function r(e,t){const o=(0,a.E1)("router-view");return(0,a.Wz)(),(0,a.Az)(o)}var s=o(4100);const i={},l=(0,s.c)(i,[["render",r]]);var u=l,c=o(8880),d=(o(6692),o(7464)),h=o.p+"img/me.a73b8cf9.jpg";const m=e=>((0,a.ED)("data-v-1659207f"),e=e(),(0,a.ii)(),e),p=m((()=>(0,a.QD)("div",{class:"me-area"},[(0,a.QD)("img",{src:h,alt:"Me"}),(0,a.QD)("p",null," Hi, I'm Jj.
