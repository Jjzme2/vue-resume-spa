This is because it allows for the separation of concerns, which makes it easier to understand and maintain the code.</p>\n<p>As you dive deeper into coding, you will find many examples of how things can be separated into different concerns. A really popular example is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This is a pattern that separates the concerns of the application into three different sections: the model, the view, and the controller.</p>\n'},1564:function(e){e.exports='<h1 id="what-is-a-static-website">What is a static website?</h1>\n<h2 id="benefits-of-static-websites">Benefits of static websites</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Speed</td>\n<td>Static websites are faster than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database to load the content.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>Static websites are more secure than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t have a database to hack.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td>Static websites are cheaper to host than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scalability</td>\n<td>Static websites are more scalable than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database to handle the load.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simplicity</td>\n<td>Static websites are easier to build and maintain than dynamic websites because they don&#39;t require a database.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id="who-could-this-be-for">Who could this be for?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Small businesses</strong>: If you&#39;re a small business owner, you can use a static website to promote your products and services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bloggers</strong>: If you&#39;re a blogger, you can use a static website to publish your content.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Developers</strong>: If you&#39;re a developer, you can use a static website to showcase your portfolio.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Non-profits</strong>: If you&#39;re a non-profit organization, you can use a static website to raise awareness for your cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Freelancers</strong>: If you&#39;re a freelancer, you can use a static website to promote your services.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Students</strong>: If you&#39;re a student, you can use a static website to showcase your projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n'},4816:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var a=o(7764),n=o(4108);function r(e,t){const o=(0,n.E1)("router-view");return(0,n.Wz)(),(0,n.Az)(o)}var s=o(4100);const i={},l=(0,s.c)(i,[["render",r]]);var u=l,c=o(8880),d=(o(6692),o(7464)),h=o.p+"img/me.a73b8cf9.jpg";const p=e=>((0,n.ED)("data-v-1659207f"),e=e(),(0,n.ii)(),e),m=p((()=>(0,n.QD)("div",{class:"me-area"},[(0,n.QD)("img",{src:h,alt:"Me"}),(0,n.QD)("p",null," Hi, I'm Jj.
