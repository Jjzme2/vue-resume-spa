We will also cover how to set up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.</p>\n<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you begin, you will need to have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A GitHub account</li>\n<li>Node.js and npm installed on your computer</li>\n<li>A domain name that you want to use for your GitHub Pages site</li>\n<li>A basic understanding of Vue.js and how to build a static web application</li>\n<li>A basic understanding of how to use the command line</li>\n<li>A basic understanding of how to use Git/Github</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="guide">Guide</h2>\n<h3 id="step-1-create-a-new-vuejs-project">Step 1: Create a new Vue.js project</h3>\n<p>First, you will need to create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI. If you don&#39;t already have the Vue CLI installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -g @vue/cli</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have the Vue CLI installed, you can create a new Vue.js project by running the following command in your terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">vue create my-vue-app</code></pre>\n<p>Replace <code>my-vue-app</code> with the name of your project.</p>\n<h3 id="step-2-build-your-vuejs-application">Step 2: Build your Vue.js application</h3>\n<p>Once you have created your new Vue.js project, you can start building your application. You can add new components, routes, and other features to your application as needed.</p>\n<h3 id="step-3-deploy-your-vuejs-application-to-github-pages">Step 3: Deploy your Vue.js application to GitHub Pages</h3>\n<p>Once you have finished building your Vue.js application, you can deploy it to GitHub Pages by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the <code>gh-pages</code> package to your project by running the following command in your terminal:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save-dev gh-pages</code></pre>\n<p>This will simplify the deployment process by automating the process of pushing your built application to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of your GitHub repository.</p>\n<ol start="2">\n<li>Add a <code>deploy</code> script to your <code>package.json</code> file that will build your application and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Add the following line to your <code>package.json</code> file:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n  &quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;vue-cli-service build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d dist&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>This script will build your application using the Vue CLI and then deploy it to GitHub Pages using the <code>gh-pages</code> package.</p>\n<ol start="3">\n<li>Deploy your application to GitHub Pages by running the following command in your terminal:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">npm run deploy</code></pre>\n<p>This will build your application and deploy it to GitHub Pages.</p>\n<h3 id="step-4-set-up-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">Step 4: Set up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site</h3>\n<p>Once you have deployed your application to GitHub Pages, you can set up a custom domain for your site by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the settings page of your GitHub repository and scroll down to the &quot;GitHub Pages&quot; section.</li>\n<li>In the &quot;Custom domain&quot; section, enter the domain name that you want to use for your GitHub Pages site.<ul>\n<li>In my case, I used Squarespace to manage my domain name. This did cost me $12 for the first year, and $20 for the next year. GitHub Pages is free, but you will need to pay for your domain name.</li>\n<li>You can also use a free domain name from GitHub Pages, but it will have the format <code>your-username.github.io</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Once you have entered your domain name, click the &quot;Save&quot; button to save your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id="step-5-verify-your-custom-domain">Step 5: Verify your custom domain</h3>\n<p>You might encounter an error saying that your domain is not properly configured. This is because you need to add a CNAME file to your repository. You can do this by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new file in the root of your repository called <code>CNAME</code>.</li>\n<li>In the <code>CNAME</code> file, enter the domain name that you want to use for your GitHub Pages site.</li>\n<li>Commit the <code>CNAME</code> file to your repository and push your changes to GitHub.</li>\n<li>Wait a few minutes for your changes to take effect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will also need to configure your settings, note that this is for Squarespace, but you can use similar settings for other domain providers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &quot;Settings&quot; page of your Squarespace account.</li>\n<li>Click on &quot;Domains&quot; and then click on the domain name that you want to use for your GitHub Pages site.</li>\n<li>Click on &quot;DNS Settings&quot; and then click on &quot;Add a custom record&quot;.<ul>\n<li>You will need to delete the default records that Squarespace provides.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><h2 id="create-a-custom-record-with-the-following-settings">Create a Custom Record with the following settings:</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Record Type</th>\n<th>Host</th>\n<th>Points to</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>CNAME</td>\n<td>www</td>\n<td>your-username.github.io</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>@</td>\n<td>185.199.108.153<br/>185.199.109.153<br/>185.199.110.153<br/>185.199.111.153</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AAAA</td>\n<td>@</td>\n<td>2606:50c0:8000:0:0:0:0:153<br/>2606:50c0:8001:0:0:0:0:153<br/>2606:50c0:8002:0:0:0:0:153<br/>2606:50c0:8003:0:0:0:0:153</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TXT</td>\n<td><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages#:~:text=Add%20a%20DNS%20TXT%20record" target="_blank">GitHub Provided</a></td>\n<td><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages#:~:text=Add%20a%20DNS%20TXT%20record" target="_blank">GitHub Provided</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id="step-6-verify-your-custom-domain">Step 6: Verify your custom domain</h3>\n<p>Once you have added the <code>CNAME</code> file to your repository and configured your domain settings, you can verify your custom domain by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the settings page of your GitHub repository and scroll down to the &quot;GitHub Pages&quot; section.</li>\n<li>In the &quot;Custom domain&quot; section, you should see a message saying &quot;Your site is published at <code>your-custom-domain.com</code>&quot;.</li>\n<li>If you see this message, your custom domain has been successfully configured and you can now access your GitHub Pages site using your custom domain.</li>\n<li>If you don&#39;t see this message, you may need to wait a few minutes for your changes to take effect.</li>\n<li>If you still don&#39;t see this message after waiting, you may need to double-check your domain settings and make sure that everything is configured correctly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or need further assistance with setting up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.
